# TableTop - Own your New Tab

## Introduction

- NOTE: The project is currently WIP.

TableTop is a New Tab extension. Inspired the macOS Dock, it aims to provide a fully customisable and feature packed New Tab page.

- Latest Release: [(v0.0.1)](https://github.com/veeru153/tabletop/releases/tag/v0.0.1)
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

### Usage

1. Download the [latest release (v0.0.1)](https://github.com/veeru153/tabletop/releases/tag/v0.0.1).
2. Extract the `tabletop` folder from the zip file and store it at a location. (You can't change the location once you load the extension into Chrome).
3. Visit the [Extensions](chrome://extensions/) page. Turn on Developer Mode (top-right corner).
4. Click on `Load Unpacked` (top-left corner) and navigate inside the `tabletop` folder extracted in Step 2.

NOTE: Disable other extensions which override the New Tab page to prevent conflicts.

Most of it works straight out of the box. You might need to supply additional information (such as API Keys) in order to use some features (such as fetching the weather).

## Other Things
